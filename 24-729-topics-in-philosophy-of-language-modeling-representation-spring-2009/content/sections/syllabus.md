Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Course Philosophy and Goals
---------------------------

The seminar will be devoted to understanding what we're up to when we ascribe contents to a person's assertions and mental attitudes. We seek to make clear the rules of the game for the philosophy of language. We'll survey classic discussions of the issue by Field, Lewis and Stalnaker. But much of the emphasis of the class will be on getting clear about the limitations of our theoretical tools. I'd like to focus on places where our theorizing runs into trouble, or breaks down altogether.

Requirements
------------

### Prerequisites

High level graduate students with sufficient training to participate in sophisticated in-class discussion. A Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy should be adequate preparation to do the course readings.

### Evaluation

Course grades will be based on the completion of a final paper. See [assignments]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments) for more information.
